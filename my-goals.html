  <h4><u>Why</u> do I want to learn this skill?</h4>
  <p>Shortly after I graduated college in 2012, I have consistently been bitten by that pesky coding, curiosity bug. When the thought consistently comes up over a longer period of time, it is quite obvious that the interest is there. I think there
    was a natural progression from enjoying mathematical equation to better understanding excel to wanting to learn computing language. As a classic, business thinker, I know the importance of understanding technology better. Currently, my team and I
    feel handicapped with technology, as we don't understand how to implement our ideas in the digital world we live in today. Learning to code will not only arm me with the knowledge to feel confident in business planning and executing on a vision,
    but it will show proof to myself and my team that I am capable of mastering this topic.</p>
  <h4>What will I <u>achieve</u> if learn this skill?</h4>
  <p>
    The possibilities are endless. There has been one constant since 2010 - I dream. My dreams for charity, for business, and for my life, can be realized with strong coding knowledge. The world has been digitized, and I don't want to be lost in the
    shuffle. My monetary goals can be achieved. I want to be able to do what I want, when I want, with who I want. In order to do that, I need to make sound investment decisions into what I learn and how I execute on my plans. Coding will help me
    make better decisions, and make <strong>WAY</strong> more money.
  </p>
  <h4>How will this skill <u>change my life</u> and my career?</h4>
  <p>
    There will be more and more opportunities for me to excel in business and execute my ideas. If I fall in love with coding, it will unlock an entirely different career path for me. I want to live a life of learning, where I constantly challenge
    myself to grow. That is easier said than done. In learning how to code, I will enstill a belief in myself and fortify that anyone who is willing, can.
  </p>
  <h4>How will learning this skill impact the <u>lives of my family</u>, friends and coworkers?</h4>
  <p>
    My motivation at times is fueled when I have an opportunity to prove someone wrong OR show someone the way. In this case, I can lift my team to bigger and better things in business. I will garner the respect of my partners, my associates, and
    potential investors. My friends will be impressed and so will my wife, Amy.
  </p>
  <h4>How will I <u>feel</u> if I never accomplish this?</h4>
  <p>
    How many times are people presented with new ideas, new opportunities, new ventures, new "insert word here"?...all. the. time. And, how often do people see things through? That is a rhetorical question. I want to see this through, because I know
    if I don't commit to completing this, it will be another example of quitting. I don't want to be a quitter. I want to be someone who is a doer - who gets things <strong>DONE</strong>.
  </p>
  <h4>What would <u>my life</u> look like if I manage to accomplish this?</h4>
  <p>
    I would wake up every morning and feel free. I know with this skillset, the world would be my oyster. I know the money would always be available and no matter what happened, I'd always have a place within an organization. I could provide for my
    family. I could explore the world. I want to unlock every corner of the Earth, and show Amy all of it.
