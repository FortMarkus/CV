      <ul><p>
        I drove from Omaha, NE to Phoenix, AZ in August of 2018, and haven't left since. My environment changing from flat to mountainous during that 24 hour drive through Denver to Moab, UT, and then South from there. When you've always enjoyed being outside and staying active, hiking becomes a natural fit. I've loved it and I hope it is always a part of my life. REI is now my favorite store, and the best weekends are the hiking-kind.
